  <p id="aboutme">
As a student at the University of Waterloo for <span id="highlight">Systems Design Engineering</span>, I have been given many opportunities to develop my technical skills and abilities. Through the university's cooperative program I have worked with start ups that range from <span id="highlight">mobile retail management</span> to <span id="highlight">sports science and biometrics</span>. I have had the privilege of working with several teams with advanced technological knowledge. As my skills have started to sharpen and mature I have started to focus them towards <span id="highlight">human factors</span> and <span id="highlight">human and computer interaction</span>. I have become very interested in <span id="highlight">bridging the gap</span> between the physical world and the digital. My personal research has taken me to the realms of <span id="highlight">natural gesture languages and intuitive, seamless interactions with digital systems</span>. Through my final years at the university and my remaining cooperative terms, I will concentrate on ways to bring real world information into the digital world in meaningful and innovative ways.
