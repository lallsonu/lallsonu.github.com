  <p id="aboutme">
As a student at the University of Waterloo for <span id="highlight">Systems Design Engineering</span>, I have been given many opportunities to develop my technical skills and abilities. Through the university's cooperative program I have worked with start ups that range from <span id="highlight">mobile retail management</span> to <span id="highlight">sports science and biometrics</span>. I have had the privilege of working with several teams with advanced technological knowledge. As my skills have started to sharpen and mature I have started to focus them towards <span id="highlight">human factors</span> and <span id="highlight">human and computer interaction</span>. I have become very interested in <span id="highlight">bridging the gap</span> between the physical world and the digital. My personal research has taken me to the realms of <span id="highlight">natural gesture languages and intuitive, seamless interactions with digital systems</span>. After I graduate, Iâ€™d like to take my past experience in health care, as well as my considerable problem solving and user experience skills to work on projects involving Human and Computer Interaction in the medical world. My ideal job would involve working on ways to bring real world information into the digital world in meaningful and innovative ways.
